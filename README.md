# Ogun State Gen AI Fellowship – AI Engineering Track

This repository documents my journey as a participant in the Ogun State Gen AI Fellowship (AI Engineering Track), organized by the Ogun State Ministry of Science and Technology and sponsored by the Bosun Tijani Foundation.

## Purpose & Structure
- **Weekly Folders (`week_1`, `week_2`, etc.)**: Each folder contains assignments, exercises, and projects completed as part of the fellowship curriculum.
- **Task Subfolders (`task_5`, `task_6`, `task_7`, etc.)**: These break down the weekly work into focused tasks, reflecting the hands-on, project-based approach of the program.
- **Python Scripts & Jupyter Notebooks**: All code and experiments are written in Python, using both scripts and notebooks for practical learning and documentation.

## Program Alignment
This repo aligns with the AI Engineering track’s goals:
- Machine Learning & Model Finetuning
- MLOps & Infrastructure
- Agentic RAG systems
- Cloud Deployment (SageMaker, Docker, etc.)
- Git & Version Control

Assignments and projects here are designed to build real-world AI engineering skills, as outlined in the [fellowship program](https://aifellowship.ogunstate.gov.ng/).
